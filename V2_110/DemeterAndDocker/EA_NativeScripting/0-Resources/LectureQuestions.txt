1. I don't understand what is happening to the UTXO after I send my transaction.  Why does the previous TxHash disappear and new ones appear??  I expected to see the new TxHash of the transaction I just sent
but I also expected to see the old one that was previously there.   Wait.. I think I know.  On homework #3 where I sent 2 tranaction to myself
and 3 transactions to Roberto is that why I have 3 TxHash in my UTXO.  Index 0 and 1 are going to me and index 5 is for the change???

2. How do I add commands to my .bashrc?
3. What are these payment.unsigned and protocol.params files?

questions from homework.  I don't get the output of Ada associated with creating native tokens or NFTs.  I minted and sent an NFT and arbirarily put 20ADA to send with that for the cost of minting the NFT. 
It took all my 20 ADA.  Why did it take all my 20 ADA? What if I put 10ADA? Doesn't make sense right now.
